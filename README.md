**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
- `preload.js` - A content script that runs before the renderer process loads.

You can learn more about each of these components in depth within the [Tutorial](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-1-prerequisites).
